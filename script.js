// CLASSES PROJECT
// In this project, you will build a Mazda car factory that manufactures both cars and trucks.
// Read each set of instructions carefully!

// BUILD YOUR FACTORY!

// DECLARE A FACTORY CLASS
// All automobiles manufacutered should have the following properties: make (Mazda), location (USA), airbags (true), abs (true), warranty (60,000 miles / 3 years)
// This factory should also run two functions: massBuild() and customerBuild()

// massBuild should receive the following parameters: quantity, options.
// It should print "Building QUANTITY COLOR TRIM MODEL's" i.e: "Building 100 blue Touring CX-5's"

// customerBuild should receive the following parameters: color, options.
// It should print "Building one COLOR TRIM MODEL with the following options: OPTIONS", i.e: "Building one red Sport Mazda3 with the following options: heated seats, rear spoiler"

// Create the Factory class bellow:
class Factory {
  constructor(make = 'Mazda',location = 'USA', airbags = true, abs = true, warranty ){
    this.make=make
    this.location=location
    this.airbags=airbags
    this.abs=abs
    this.warranty= '60,000 miles / 3 years'
  }
  massBuild (quantity,options){
    return `Building ${quantity} ${this.color} ${this.trim} ${this.model}`
  }
  customerBuild(color, options){
    return `Building one ${color} ${this.trim} ${this.model} with the following options:${options}`
  }
}



// CREATE A SUB-CLASS CALLED CAR
// It should extend from Factory.
// The constructor should have the following properties: model, doors, color, enginetype, transmission, trim, wheelstrim, audio, seatstrim, moonroof. The values should be specified when creating an instance of Car.
// It should specifically inherit the warranty property from Factory so we can modify it.
// Car should also have the following additional properties: enginesize (4), navigation (true), backupcamera (true), warranty (100,000 miles / 5 years)
// Write your code below:
class Car extends Factory {
  constructor(color, model, enginetype, transmission, trim, wheelstrim, audio, seatstrim, moonroof,doors= 2, warranty){
    super()
    this.color = color
    this.model = model
    this.enginetype = enginetype
    this.transmission = transmission
    this.trim = trim
    this.wheelstrim = wheelstrim
    this.audio = audio
    this.seatstrim = seatstrim
    this.moonroof = moonroof
    this.doors = doors
    this.enginesize = 4
    this.navigation = true
    this.backupcamera = true
    this.warranty = '100,000 miles / 5 years'
  }
}


// CREATE A SUB-CLASS CALLED SPORT
// It should extend from Car.
// The constructor should have the following properties: model, trim, transmission, top, color, seatstrim, audio, wheelstrim. The values should be specified when creating an instance of Sport.
// Sports cars should also have the following additional properties: moonroof (false), enginetype (gasoline), convertible (true), doors (2)
// Write your code below:
class Sport extends Car {
  constructor(model, trim, transmission, top, color, seatstrim, audio, wheelstrim){
    super()
    this.model = model
    this.trim = trim
    this.transmission = transmission
    this.color = color
    this.seatstrim = seatstrim
    this.audio = audio
    this.wheelstrim = wheelstrim
    this.moonroof = false
    this.enginetype = 'gasoline'
    this.convertible = true
    this.doors = 2
  }
}


// CREATE A SUB-CLASS CALLED TRUCK
// Yes...this Mazda factory makes trucks....
// It should extend from 'Factory'.
// The constructor should have the following properties: model, color, enginesize, hitch, bed, navigation. The values should be specified when creating an instance of Truck.
// Truck should also have the following properties, standard: backupcamera (true), audio (basic)
// It should also inherit the warranty property so we can extend it to: 150,000 miles / 6 years.
// Write your code below:
class Truck extends Factory {
  constructor(model, color, trim, enginesize, hitch, bed, navigation, backupcamera, audio, warranty){
    super()
    this.model = model
    this.color = color
    this.trim = trim
    this.enginesize = enginesize
    this.hitch = hitch
    this.bed = bed
    this.navigation = navigation
    this.backupcamera = true
    this.audio = 'basic'
    this.warranty = '150,000 miles / 6 years'
  }

}



// LET'S BUILD SOME CARS AND TRUCKS!

// MAZDA3 MASS PRODUCTION

// It should print: "Building 35000 Red Touring Mazda3's."
// Write your code below:
console.log(mazda3.massBuild(35000));

// Print miataRf. It should have all of the above properties. Plus, the extended warranty.
// Write your code below:
console.log(miataRf);




// Print miataRf, calling massBuild(), building 15,000
// It should print: "Building 15000 Red Grand Touring Miata-RF's."
// Write your code below:
console.log(miataRf.massBuild(15000));




// Print miataRf, calling customerBuild(), building one black Miata-Rf with the following options, as an array: hid headlights, sports suspension, leather steering wheel, heated seats, adaptive cruise control.
// It should read: "Building one black Grand Touring Miata-RF with the following options: hid headlights, sports suspension, leather steering wheel, heated seats, adaptive cruise control"
// Write your code below:
console.log(miataRf.customerBuild('black',['hid headlights', 'sports suspension', 'leather steering wheel', 'heated seats', 'adaptive cruise control ']));



// TRAIL BLAZER MASS PRODUCTION
// The Trail Blazer should inherit from truck.
// The following properties must be specified: model (Trail Blazer), color (blue), trim (Sport), enginesize (8), hitch (true), bed (standard), navigation (true), doors (2)

// Print trailBlazer. It should have all the above properties. Plus, the extended warranty.
// Write your code below:
console.log(trailBlazer);



// Print trailBlazer, calling massBuid(). It should build 35000 trucks.
// It should print: "Building 35000 blue Sport Trail Blazer's."
// Wrint your code below:
console.log(trailBlazer.massBuild(35000));
